# City Ride

This is a beginner-level React-based project with firebase authentication. On this website home page, we can see some vehicle's names, images, and ride buttons. By clicking this button, we can select our destination and date. After selecting when we click the search button we can find an available ride for our selecting vehicle.

Here we use React-routing, Firebase authentication, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and javascript ES6 features.
